# portfolio

This is my portfolio containing navigation links in the header section, that bring the user to an about me, projects, and contact me section. In the about me section the user will learn a little about be the developer, the projects section has shown the few projects that I have done so far, and the contact me section has the best way to contact me about projects or work in the future.
